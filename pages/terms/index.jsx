                  "These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Xhibiter website(s), our APIs, mobile app (the “App”), and any other software, tools, features, or functionalities provided on or in connection with our services; including without limitation using our services to view, explore, and create NFTs and use our tools, at your own discretion, to connect directly with others to purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public blockchains (collectively, the “Service”). “NFT” in these Terms means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data. For purposes of these Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your” means you as the user of the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity's behalf."

              <p>
                PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN
                IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED
                IN SECTION 16 BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION
                AGREEMENT AND className ACTION WAIVER WHICH (WITH LIMITED
                EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED
                THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY A JUDGE OR JURY IN
                COURT.
              </p>
              <p>
                BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT AND/OR USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE
                BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY
                REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT
                ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.
              </p>

              <p>
                Xhibiter is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial
                institution, or creditor. Xhibiter provides a peer-to-peer web3
                service that helps users discover and directly interact with
                each other and NFTs available on public blockchains. We do not
                have custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains you are
                interacting with and we do not execute or effectuate purchases,
                transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service, you must use a
                third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on
                blockchains.
              </p>

              <p>
                Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need
                to provide additional terms for specific services (and such
                services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall
                also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and
                conditions, which are available with the relevant service, then
                become part of your agreement with us if you use those services.
                In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any
                additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific
                service, such additional terms shall control for that specific
                service.
              </p>

                designs, text, graphics, pictures, data, software, sound files,
                other files, and the selection and arrangement thereof are the
                proprietary property of Xhibiter or our affiliates, licensors,
                or users, as applicable, and you agree not to take any action(s)
                inconsistent with such ownership interests. We and our
                affiliates, licensors, and users, as applicable, reserve all
                rights in connection with the Service and its content,

              <h2>License to Access and Use Our Service and Content</h2>

              <p>
                You are hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable,
                nonsublicensable, and personal license to access and use the
                Service provided, however, that such license is subject to your
                compliance with these Terms. If any software, content, or other
                materials owned by, controlled by, or licensed to us are
                distributed or made available to you as part of your use of the
                Service, we hereby grant you a non-commercial, personal,
                non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, and
                non-exclusive right and license to access and display such
                software, content, and materials provided to you as part of the
                Service (and right to download a single copy of the App onto
                your applicable equipment or device), in each case for the sole
                purpose of enabling you to use the Service as permitted by these
                Terms, provided that your license in any content linked to or
                associated with any NFTs is solely as set forth by the
                applicable seller or creator of such NFT.
              </p>

              <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>

              <p>
                You are solely responsible for your use of the Service and for
                any information you provide, including compliance with
                applicable laws, rules, and regulations, as well as these Terms,
                including the User Conduct requirements outlined above.
              </p>

              <p>
                By using the Service in conjunction with creating, submitting,
                posting, promoting, or displaying content, or by complying with{" "}
                {"OpenSea's"} metadata standards in your metadata API responses,
                you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable,
                royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, and display any
                content, including but not limited to text, materials, images,
                files, communications, comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas,
                concepts, questions, data, or otherwise, that you submit or post
                on or through the Service for our current and future business
                purposes, including to provide, promote, and improve the
                Service. This includes any digital file, art, or other material
                linked to or associated with any NFTs that are displayed on the
                Service.

              <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

              <p>
                These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and
                Xhibiter relating to your access to and use of the Service.
                These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may
                not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written
                consent of Xhibiter, and Xhibiter’s failure to assert any right
                or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of
                such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any breach
                or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
                preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings
                used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have
                any legal effect.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Service is operated by us in the United States. Those who
                choose to access the Service from locations outside the United
                States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for
                compliance with applicable local laws. You and Xhibiter agree
                that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
                International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation
                or construction of these Terms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended
                solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to
                confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or
                entity.
